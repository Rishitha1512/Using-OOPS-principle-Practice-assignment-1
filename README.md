# Library Management System

## Project Description

This is a simple library management system built in JavaScript. It involves two main entities: `Book` and `User`. Users can borrow and return books, while each book has an availability status.

## Classes
1. **Book Class**:
   - `title`: Title of the book (string).
   - `author`: Author of the book (string).
   - `isbn`: ISBN of the book (string).
   - `isAvailable`: Boolean that shows if the book is available for borrowing (default: `true`).
   - Methods: 
     - `borrowBook()`: Marks the book as unavailable.
     - `returnBook()`: Marks the book as available.

2. **User Class**:
   - `name`: Name of the user (string).
   - `id`: User ID (number).
   - `borrowedBooks`: Array of books borrowed by the user.
   - Methods:
     - `borrow(book)`: Adds a book to `borrowedBooks` if available.
     - `return(book)`: Removes a book from `borrowedBooks`.

## Demo

1. A book is borrowed and marked as unavailable.
2. A second user tries to borrow the same book while itâ€™s unavailable.
3. The first user returns the book, making it available for borrowing again.
4. Users can borrow and return multiple books.
